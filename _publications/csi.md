title: "On the improvement in secure-reliable communication performance of a cooperative cognitive network under CSI availability"
collection: publications

excerpt: 'The rapid growth of wireless communication over the last couple of decades has led to an ever-increasing demand for radio spectrum, resulting in a significant spectrum deficit. This scarcity prompted the search for more efficient utilization of the available spectrum. Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have emerged as a promising solution to spectrum scarcity by enabling secondary users to opportunistically access underutilized spectrum without causing harmful interference to primary users. We intend to investigate the performance improvement of an underlay cooperative cognitive radio network with an eavesdropping AF relay node in a semi-duplex transmission model with destination-assisted jamming under three different CSI availabitlity regimes.'
